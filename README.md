# irisRead
Iris-Read is a voiceAI created to read The Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons Series by Monique Finley.


## Game Plan
Iris-Read will initially function as a chatbot that's versed in all things Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons. Later, I'll enable Iris to read the book (audo book player), search blockchains (Ethereum, LOOM, Steem), and reveal nesteggs (surprises for [metamask] logged in users). 

1. Short Term: Teach Iris about the books of The Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons Series. </br>
a. https://www.pushingbhutons.com </br>
b. https://book1.pushingbhutons.com </br>
c. https://book2.pushingbhutons.com </br>
d. http://wiki.pushingbhutons.com </br>

2. Long Term: Teach Iris about the greater Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons universe </br>
a. Zeemz: The Versipisces Secret (erc721 compliant digital trading card game based off short story, 'Poseidon Knows' by Monique Finley) </br>
b. 'Poseidon Knows' (horror story about the "abandoned" Port Askance) </br>
c. other related short stories </br>


## SnipsAIR
irisRead repo serves the actions for the Iris-Read app I'm building in the [SnipsAIR](https://console.snips.ai/?ref=yM6gdKP7E0E) console. This technology is enterprise / IoT ready, blockchain based, "privacy by design" oriented, with a decentralized app store.

## TODO
1. Finish training Iris
2. Test Iris
3. Deploy Iris to all Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons related websites
4. Verify Iris' functionality (production testing)
